# Apple Quiz

I used `ruby-2.3.0` for this assignment. Also note that to run these Ruby scripts, you may have to give the correct file permissions: `chmod +x [filename].rb`.

## Q1 = OOP Basics

### A

Please run `q1/q1_a.rb`. You can find the `Foobar` class in `q1/foobar.rb`. I also implemented a validator class in `q1/validators/foobar_input_validator.rb` to validate inputs.

### B

I used the `minitest` gem as my unit test framework. You must `gem install minitest` and then run `ruby -Ilib:test ./q1/tests/test_foobar.rb` to run the test.
